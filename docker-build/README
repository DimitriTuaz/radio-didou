# Docker Build for Radio-didou

This image is meant to be a builder for radio-didou while build.sh is the
build script.

It contains the latest version of NodeJS and the necessary node modules
are cached when you build the image.

To build the image, run this command from this folder:

docker build -t paeolo/radiod-builder .

This image is meant to be used with the .drone.yml file that configure the
Drone CI server.
